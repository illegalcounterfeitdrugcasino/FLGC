            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Free Luxury Giveaway Casino (FLGC), a promotional and entertainment platform operated by Bitflash Enterprises. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of FLGC, including all content, features, and services provided through the platform. By accessing FLGC, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                FLGC is a frontend-only, browser-based application designed to simulate a giveaway and casino-like experience for entertainment purposes. It collects user data via Google Firebase, as detailed below. These Terms provide comprehensive details about the platform’s operations, limitations, and disclaimers, particularly regarding its fictional nature and simulated content.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="nature-of-platform">
            <h2>Nature of the FLGC Platform</h2>
            <h3>Promotional and Fictional Experience</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC is not a real casino, gambling platform, or prize distribution service. It is a fictional, promotional platform that simulates the experience of participating in giveaways and casino-like activities. All content, including references to "prizes," "luxury items," "black markets," or "illegal activities," is purely fictional and intended for entertainment purposes only.
            </p>
            <h3>Frontend-Only Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC operates entirely within your web browser, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data logging handled by Google Firebase. There is no backend server for user account management, authentication, or real-time moderation, meaning:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No user accounts are created or stored.</li>
                <li>No real-time banning or user-specific restrictions are enforced.</li>
                <li>All interactions are client-side, and any restrictions (e.g., compatibility warnings for older devices) are implemented via browser-based checks.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>
                    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> FLGC’s frontend-only nature means we cannot enforce bans or restrictions on individual users. References to "banning" or "termination" in these Terms are aspirational and reflect our intent to maintain a safe environment, but they are not technically enforceable due to the platform’s architecture.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="eligibility">
            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
                To access FLGC, you must meet the following criteria:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reside in a jurisdiction where access to simulated giveaway or casino-like platforms is not prohibited by law.</li>
                <li>Not be located in a country or region subject to international sanctions, embargoes, or restrictions that prohibit access to FLGC.</li>
                <li>Have a compatible device and browser (e.g., modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) capable of running FLGC’s JavaScript-based features.</li>
                <li>Agree to comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, including those related to simulated gambling, data privacy, and online conduct.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for verifying that your use of FLGC complies with all applicable laws. Bitflash Enterprises reserves the right to limit access to the platform based on device compatibility or legal restrictions, though such limitations are enforced via frontend checks only.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="platform-use">
            <h2>Platform Use and Restrictions</h2>
            <h3>Permitted Use</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC is provided solely for personal, non-commercial entertainment. You may use the platform to engage with its simulated giveaway and casino-like features, provided you adhere to these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
            <p>
                You agree not to engage in any of the following activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attempting to access or manipulate the platform’s admin mode or Firebase data collection processes without authorization.</li>
                <li>Using automated tools, bots, or scripts to interact with FLGC, scrape content, or simulate user activity.</li>
                <li>Distributing malware, viruses, or other harmful code through the platform.</li>
                <li>Engaging in any activity that disrupts, overloads, or impairs the platform’s performance, such as denial-of-service attacks.</li>
                <li>Using FLGC to promote or engage in illegal activities, including but not limited to black market transactions, illegal advertising, or unauthorized prize distributions.</li>
                <li>Reverse-engineering, decompiling, or otherwise attempting to extract the platform’s source code or data.</li>
                <li>Misrepresenting your identity, location, or intentions when interacting with FLGC’s setup or data collection processes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Due to FLGC’s frontend-only nature, enforcement of these restrictions relies on browser-based checks and Firebase security rules. Violations may not result in immediate bans but could lead to legal action if they involve illegal conduct.

            <ul>
                <li>No prizes depicted in the Prize Library or elsewhere on FLGC are real or available for redemption.</li>
                <li>References to "illegal prizes" (e.g., contraband, restricted goods) are fictional elements designed to enhance the platform’s thematic experience and do not reflect real-world activities.</li>
                <li>FLGC does not conduct, endorse, or facilitate black market transactions or illegal prize distributions.</li>
                <li>You will not rely on FLGC for any expectation of receiving real-world rewards, monetary value, or tangible benefits.</li>

            <p>
                FLGC may include simulated advertisements or promotional content as part of its fictional casino and giveaway experience. This content may reference:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Illegal ads" (e.g., promotions for prohibited goods or services).</li>
                <li>"Black markets" (e.g., fictional marketplaces for illicit items).</li>
                <li>Other controversial or exaggerated themes to enhance the platform’s narrative.</li>

            <h2>Frontend-Only Limitations</h2>
            <h3>No Backend Enforcement</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC’s frontend-only architecture means it operates entirely within your browser, with data logging handled by Firebase. As a result:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no server-side user management, authentication, or moderation system.</li>
                <li>We cannot enforce real-time bans, suspensions, or individual user restrictions.</li>
                <li>Any compatibility checks (e.g., `isOlderDevice()` function) or restrictions are implemented via JavaScript and can be bypassed by technically savvy users.</li>
                <li>Security relies on Firebase’s access controls and browser-based protections, not active server monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Implications for Users</h3>
            <p>
                You acknowledge that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>References to "banning" or "termination" in these Terms reflect our intent to maintain a safe environment but are not technically enforceable.</li>
                <li>FLGC cannot prevent repeat access by users who violate these Terms, except through legal action in extreme cases.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for using FLGC in good faith and reporting any misuse to <a href="mailto:cooktim.521@gmail.com">cooktim.521@gmail.com</a>.</li>

            <p>
                Bitflash Enterprises may attempt to limit your access to FLGC for reasons including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation of these Terms (e.g., attempting to access admin mode).</li>
