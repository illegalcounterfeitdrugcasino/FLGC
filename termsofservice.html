            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Free Luxury Giveaway Casino (FLGC), a promotional and entertainment platform operated by Bitflash Enterprises. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of FLGC, including all content, features, services, and the account system provided through the platform. By accessing FLGC, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="/privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                FLGC is a frontend-only, browser-based application designed to simulate a giveaway and casino-like experience for entertainment purposes only. It uses Google Firebase for data logging, analytics, and account management, with extensive data collection performed upon agreeing to these Terms. The platform includes simulated games, fictional prizes, promotional content, and an account system for personalized gameplay, all of which are not real and are intended solely for thematic entertainment. These Terms provide comprehensive details about the platform’s operations, limitations, data practices, game mechanics, administrative controls, account system, and disclaimers, particularly regarding its fictional nature and simulated content.
            </p>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>
                    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> FLGC is a fictional entertainment platform. No real prizes, money, or goods are awarded. All references to gambling, prizes, black markets, or illegal activities are purely fictional and for thematic purposes only. FLGC does not engage in real-world transactions, gambling, or illegal activities.

        <section id="account-system">
            <h2>Account System</h2>
            <h3>Account Creation and Key-Based Authentication</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC uses a key-based account system to provide a personalized experience without requiring traditional user accounts or passwords. Upon first accessing the platform, you will be prompted to set up an account through the setup screen, where you provide a display name and location (auto-filled via geolocation, if permitted). After agreeing to these Terms, the platform generates a unique <code>accountKey</code> for you, stored in Firebase Firestore under the "accounts" collection and is NOT linked to other collected data.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Key:</strong> The <code>accountKey</code> is a unique identifier that links your gameplay data (e.g., Bitflash Bucks, spins, VIP level, jackpot progress) to your session. It is generated client-side and sent to Firebase during the initial setup process.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Your account data, including the <code>accountKey</code>, display name, location, and gameplay progress, is stored securely in Firebase Firestore with encryption and access controls, as detailed in the <a href="/privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Login:</strong> To log in on a new device or browser, you must provide your <code>accountKey</code>. This key allows anyone possessing it to access your account, including all associated data and progress. You are responsible for keeping your <code>accountKey</code> secure and not sharing it with others.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Account data is saved to Firebase Firestore whenever you select "Log out & Save".</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Account Key Security</h3>
            <p>
                Your <code>accountKey</code> is critical to maintaining the security of your account. Be aware that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone with access to your <code>accountKey</code> can log in to your account, view your data, and modify your gameplay progress (e.g., spend Bitflash Bucks, use spins).</li>
                <li>Bitflash Enterprises does not store or manage your <code>accountKey</code> on your behalf. If you lose your key, you may lose access to your account unless you have saved it locally (e.g., via <code>localStorage</code> or clipboard).</li>
                <li>If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, contact <a href="mailto:bitflashelp@gmail.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3e5c574a585255475c5158497e59535f5752105d5153">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> immediately. Note that recovery options are limited due to the frontend-only architecture.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Account Data Management</h3>
            <p>
                Your account data includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gameplay progress (e.g., Bitflash Bucks, spins left, VIP level, jackpot progress, streak count).</li>
                <li>Customizations (e.g., display name, location).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can manage your account data through the platform’s interface, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requesting access to or deletion of your data by contacting <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7d5dec3d1dbd6c4dfd2dbc7f7d0dad6dedb99d4d8da"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5f3d362b39333e2c373a332f1f38323e3633713c3032">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, subject to legal requirements.</li>
                <li>Restoring your account on a new device by entering your <code>accountKey</code> in the account login screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>
                    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> You are solely responsible for securing your <code>accountKey</code>. Bitflash Enterprises is not liable for unauthorized access, loss of account data, or misuse resulting from sharing or losing your key. Due to the frontend-only design, account recovery options are limited.

        <section id="nature-of-platform">
            <h2>Nature of the FLGC Platform</h2>
            <h3>Promotional and Fictional Experience</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC is not a real casino, gambling platform, or prize distribution service. It is a fictional, promotional platform that simulates the experience of participating in giveaways and casino-like activities. All content, including references to "prizes," "luxury items," "black markets," "illegal activities," or "jackpots," is purely fictional and intended for entertainment purposes only. The platform operates as a single-page application within your web browser, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data logging and account management handled by Google Firebase Firestore.
            </p>
            <h3>Frontend-Only Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC operates entirely within your web browser, with no backend server for user account management, authentication, or real-time moderation. Key characteristics include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Account data is managed client-side and stored in Firebase Firestore using a unique <code>accountKey</code>.</li>
                <li>Data logging occurs via Firebase Firestore, capturing device, network, and usage information as detailed in the Data Collection section.</li>
                <li>Simulated games (e.g., Slots, Wheel, Crash, Plinko, Roulette, Blackjack) run locally in the browser using JavaScript-based randomization.</li>
                <li>Administrative controls, such as IP banning or content moderation, are limited by the frontend-only design and rely on Firebase security rules and browser-based checks.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>
                    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> FLGC’s frontend-only nature means we cannot enforce real-time user-specific restrictions or bans beyond IP-based checks via Firebase. References to "banning" or "termination" are aspirational and reflect our intent to maintain a safe environment, but technical enforcement is limited.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Service Worker and Offline Mode</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC uses a Service Worker to cache assets for faster loading and limited offline functionality. In offline mode, features requiring internet access (e.g., Firebase data logging, IP banning checks, version validation, or account data syncing) are unavailable, and the platform operates in a reduced-capacity state. Users are prompted to reconnect to the internet to access full functionality, including account login and data persistence.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="eligibility">
            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
                To access FLGC, you must meet the following criteria:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reside in a jurisdiction where access to simulated giveaway or casino-like platforms is not prohibited by law.</li>
                <li>Not be located in a country or region subject to international sanctions, embargoes, or restrictions that prohibit access to FLGC (e.g., jurisdictions listed by OFAC or other regulatory bodies).</li>
                <li>Have a compatible device and browser (e.g., modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) capable of running FLGC’s JavaScript-based features, WebGL, and Firebase integration.</li>
                <li>Not have an IP address listed in FLGC’s Firebase "banned_ips" collection, as checked during the initial terms agreement process.</li>
                <li>Agree to comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, including those related to simulated gambling, data privacy, and online conduct.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for verifying that your use of FLGC complies with all applicable laws. Bitflash Enterprises reserves the right to limit access based on device compatibility, legal restrictions, or IP bans, though such limitations are enforced via frontend checks and Firebase queries only.
            </p>
            <div class="disclaimer">
                <p>
                    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> FLGC does not verify your location or legal eligibility beyond IP-based checks. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all applicable laws before using the platform.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="platform-use">
            <h2>Platform Use and Restrictions</h2>
            <h3>Permitted Use</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC is provided solely for personal, non-commercial entertainment. You may use the platform to engage with its simulated games (Slots, Wheel, Crash, Plinko, Roulette, Blackjack), view fictional promotional content, interact with features like the chat system, and manage your account, provided you adhere to these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
            <p>
                You agree not to engage in any of the following activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attempting to access or manipulate the platform’s admin mode, Firebase Firestore data, or other restricted systems without authorization.</li>
                <li>Sharing or misusing another user’s <code>accountKey</code> to access their account without permission.</li>
                <li>Using automated tools, bots, or scripts to interact with FLGC, scrape content, simulate user activity, or bypass spin limits.</li>
                <li>Engaging in any activity that disrupts, overloads, or impairs the platform’s performance, such as denial-of-service attacks.</li>
                <li>Using FLGC to promote or engage in illegal activities, including but not limited to black market transactions, illegal advertising, or unauthorized prize distributions.</li>
                <li>Reverse-engineering, decompiling, or otherwise attempting to extract the platform’s source code, Firebase configuration, or data.</li>
                <li>Attempting to bypass IP bans or other restrictions implemented via Firebase or browser-based checks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Enforcement of these restrictions relies on Firebase security rules, browser-based checks, and IP banning via the "banned_ips" collection. Violations may result in an IP ban or legal action if they involve illegal conduct. Due to the frontend-only architecture, immediate enforcement of user-specific bans is not feasible.
            </p>
            <div class="disclaimer">

            <h2>IP Banning and Access Restrictions</h2>
            <h3>IP Ban Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                FLGC implements IP-based access restrictions using Firebase Firestore’s "banned_ips" collection. During the initial terms agreement process (<code>handleInitialTermsAgree</code>), the platform:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fetches your IP address via ipapi.co.</li>
                <li>Queries the "banned_ips" collection to check if your IP is listed.</li>
                <li>Denies access if your IP is banned, displaying a popup with instructions to contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4c2e25382a202d3f242920370c2b212d2520622f2321"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5e3c372a38323f2d363b322e1e39333f3732703d3133">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reasons for IP Banning</h3>
            <p>
                Your IP may be banned for reasons including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violating these Terms (e.g., attempting to access admin mode without authorization or misusing another user’s <code>accountKey</code>).</li>
                <li>Engaging in suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity (e.g., using bots or scripts).</li>
                <li>Repeated attempts to bypass platform restrictions or security measures.</li>
                <li>Requests by law enforcement or government authorities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Appealing an IP Ban</h3>
            <p>
                If your IP is banned, you may contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#593b302d3f35382a313c3529193e34383035773a3634"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5c3e35283a303d2f3439302c1c3b313d3530723f3331">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> to appeal. Appeals must include your IP address, a description of the issue, and any relevant evidence. Bitflash Enterprises reserves the right to uphold or lift bans at its discretion.

            <p>
                FLGC’s frontend-only architecture means it operates entirely within your browser, with data logging and account management handled by Firebase. As a result:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no server-side user management, authentication, or moderation system beyond Firebase Firestore.</li>

                <li>Account security relies on the secrecy of your <code>accountKey</code>, and unauthorized access cannot be fully prevented without IP bans.</li>
                <li>Compatibility checks and restrictions are implemented via JavaScript and can be bypassed by technically savvy users.</li>
                <li>Security relies on Firebase’s access controls and browser-based protections, not active server monitoring.</li>

         It's generally added by Cloudflare itself and not something you'd typically include manually unless specifically needed for their services.
